**User Story / Problem / Details**
We want to produce content based from our interviews that is impactful to students and makes the professionals who do our interviews excited to share it. We will be sharing the content in different forms across different channels and as a result need to develop content that is customized to each platform. To do so we need to create at least 2 short posts for TikTok & Instagram (includes a caption, hashtags, timestamp of the content and how the content creator will make the content), a medium post (4-6 minutes) for LinkedIn (includes caption and hashtags) or an article (created on Medium and has hashtags/a caption), and a podcast (the whole interview that is timestamped and cut where appropriate that has a caption, a timestamp for the interview and an intro). In addition, the content editor must timestamp each question and answer along with providing tags that help filter the interview to particular topics.

**Technical Definition of Done**
All three types of content are created and approved by Bryan as well as the timestamps for each question/answer are added as a Google Sheet to the folder

**Definition of Ready**
Brett has approved each of the content pieces


**Process**
- [ ] Short Content (2 Instagram & TikTok posts with the captions, content layout/idea, and hashtags
- [ ] Medium: 5-8 mins Linked In Video or Medium article. Each piece of content will have the caption and hashtags.
- [ ] Long: A podcast with the timestamps for where the editor needs to cut the interview. It must also include the caption, hashtags and introduction in the How I Built This Podcast format
- [ ] Interview Timestamp: Using a Google Sheet that is uploaded into each interview folder that shows the timestamp of each interview question and answer as well as an analysis from the content editor about whether the question/answer had a good point.
