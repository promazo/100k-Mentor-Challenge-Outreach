**User Story / Problem / Details**
ProMazo wants to make sure that we are reaching out to a variety of business leaders for our executive interview series. In order to make sure that we do that, we need to be reading about and identifying the up and coming leaders at corporations. These papers/magazines provide a good gauge to identify who are good targets for us to choose.

**Technical Definition of Done**
5 Contacts who are from the target company and have the titles (CXO, CCO, CHRO, CEO, Head of D&I, CTO/CIO, Head of Talent Acquisition, Head of University Recruiting, Head of the Foundations) we are targeting will be entered in our 100k Mentor Google Sheet. In addition to the contacts, we need to pull the writers and their contact information so that we can connect with them in the future as well. There should also be a link to the article so we can review it beforehand.

**Definition of Ready**
Brett reviews the contacts, the contact information and customizations and determines that the information was entered correctly for each of the ten contacts and that the personalizations are sufficiently customized.


**Process**
- [ ] Identify the target company(ies)
- [ ] Identify the types of people you want to target
- [ ] Use Hunter, RocketReach and other tools to ID the potential email
- [ ] Enter the contact's information in the sheet
- [ ] Create customizations/personalizations for the contact's email
