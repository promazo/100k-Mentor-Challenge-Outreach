**User Story / Problem / Details**
In order to make companies aware of the opportunity to join the 100k Mentor Challenge we need to reach leaders who have decision making power. To reach these individuals, part of our outreach strategy is to utilize a cold email campaign to bring on as many diverse companies as possible. The first step of that process is locating their contact information and uploading it to Hubspot. 

**Technical Definition of Done**
10 Contacts who are from the target company and have the titles (CXO, CCO, CHRO, CEO, Head of D&I, CTO/CIO, Head of Talent Acquisition, Head of University Recruiting, Head of the Foundations) we are targeting will be entered in our 100k Mentor Google Sheet 

**Definition of Ready**
Brett reviews the contacts, the contact information and customizations and determines that the information was entered correctly for each of the ten contacts and that the personalizations are sufficiently customized.


**Process**
- [ ] Identify the target company(ies)
- [ ] Identify the types of people you want to target
- [ ] Use Hunter, RocketReach and other tools to ID the potential email
- [ ] Enter the contact's information in the sheet
- [ ] Create customizations/personalizations for the contact's email
