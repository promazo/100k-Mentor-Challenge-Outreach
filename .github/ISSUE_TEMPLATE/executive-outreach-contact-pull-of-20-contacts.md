**User Story / Problem / Details**
ProMazo wants to help students who are struggling to understand where to go in their careers. To do so we have developed a video series that conducts interviews with executives and business leaders to document their advice for young people who are about to graduate and so that they can tell their own stories about how they became leaders themselves.

**Technical Definition of Done**
20 Contacts who are from a target company and have the titles (CXO, CCO, CHRO, CEO, Head of Innovation, Sr. Engineer, Head of Data Science, Head of Analytics, Senior Programming lead, Principle, Director,Head of D&I, CTO/CIO, Head of Talent Acquisition, Head of University Recruiting, Head of the Foundations, etc.) we are targeting will be entered in our Executive Outreach Google Sheet 

**Definition of Ready**
Brett reviews the contacts, the contact information and customizations and determines that the information was entered correctly for each of the ten contacts and that the personalizations are sufficiently customized.


**Process**
- [ ] Identify the target company(ies)
- [ ] Identify the types of people you want to target
- [ ] Use Hunter, RocketReach and other tools to ID the potential email
- [ ] Enter the contact's information in the sheet
- [ ] Create customizations/personalizations for the contact's email
