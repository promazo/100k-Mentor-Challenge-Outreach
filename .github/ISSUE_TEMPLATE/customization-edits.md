User Story / Problem / Details
ProMazo wants to ensure that the customizations that we do are going to hook our contacts. Any customizations that fall short will need to be redone.

Technical Definition of Done
Any customizations that are highlighted in Yellow, Red or Orange should be redone and once they are they should be marked with a purple background.

Definition of Ready
Brett reviews the new customizations and approves them (changes color to green)

Process

- [ ] Conduct additional research and find a new angle for any contact whose customization is highlighted red, orange or yellow. There may be a note to give additional context so read that first.
- [ ] Create a new customization based on the research and change the background color of the customization to purple
- [ ] It is complete once Brett or the editor moves the color to green
